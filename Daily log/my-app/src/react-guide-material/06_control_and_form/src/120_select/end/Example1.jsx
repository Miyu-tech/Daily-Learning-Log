### What I Learned About React Hooks

**1. What is a Hook?**
A Hook is a special function in React that lets you "hook into" React features inside a functional component. In other words, Hooks allow normal JavaScript functions to use React’s built-in capabilities such as state management, lifecycle handling, and references to DOM elements.

React calls them “Hooks” because they let you *hook* into React’s internal logic and add functionality to your components.

**2. Why Hooks are important**
Before Hooks were introduced, React developers used *class components* to handle state and lifecycle events. Hooks make it possible to use these features in simpler *function components*, which are easier to write, test, and reuse.

**3. Commonly used Hooks**

| Hook                  | Description                                                            | Example use case                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useState`            | Stores and updates component state.                                    | Counting button clicks, toggling light/dark mode.                                                  |
| `useEffect`           | Runs code when something changes (side effects).                       | Fetching data, setting up timers, updating the document title.                                     |
| `useRef`              | Accesses or stores a mutable value that does not trigger re-rendering. | Focusing an input field, storing a DOM element reference.                                          |
| `useContext`          | Shares data globally without passing props manually.                   | Theme settings, authentication info.                                                               |
| `useMemo`             | Remembers a computed value to avoid unnecessary recalculations.        | Optimizing performance for expensive calculations.                                                 |
| `useCallback`         | Remembers a function to avoid unnecessary re-creations.                | Passing stable callback functions to child components.                                             |
| `useImperativeHandle` | Customizes what a parent component can access via a child’s `ref`.     | When a parent needs to trigger a function inside a child component (e.g., reset form, play video). |

**4. Simple example with `useState`**

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // "count" stores the state, "setCount" updates it.

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+1</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

---

**5. Simple example with `useEffect`**

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

function Hello() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("The page has loaded!");
  }, []); // Empty array means it runs only once when mounted.
}
```

**6. When to use Hooks**
Hooks are used in almost every React project. The most common ones are `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`. More advanced Hooks like `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `useImperativeHandle` are used when optimizing performance or handling complex UI logic.

---

**7. Summary**

* Hooks give function components special React abilities.
* They replace the need for class components in most cases.
* The most essential Hooks to learn first are:

  * `useState`
  * `useEffect`
  * `useRef`
* `useImperativeHandle` is rarely used but useful in advanced situations.

Hooks make React simpler, more readable, and more powerful.
