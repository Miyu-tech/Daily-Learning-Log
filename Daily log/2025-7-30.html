・HTML Structure
Used <section> to semantically group different parts of the layout.

    Implemented an <audio> element to embed and loop background sound.

        Used <svg> and <circle> to prepare a circular timer UI.

                Learned how to use data-* attributes (e.g., data-sound, data-img) to store custom information on
                elements.

                ・CSS & SVG
                Explored viewBox="0 0 220 220" in SVG to define the coordinate system.

                Understood <circle>'s use of cx, cy, and r to position and size the shape.

                    Styled and centered elements with position: absolute, top, left, and transform: translate(-50%,
                    -50%).

                    ・UI/UX Practice
                    Designed a relaxing user interface with sound options and visual feedback.

                    Practiced creating reusable, responsive components using HTML and CSS classes.

                    Focused on clean structure and accessibility (e.g., alt attributes for images).
